# Technical Stack Rules for Golf-Compete

## Frontend Framework
- Use Next.js App Router for all new page development
- Implement server components where possible to reduce client-side JavaScript
- Use client components only when necessary (for interactivity, state management, or browser APIs)
- Follow the Next.js recommended patterns for data fetching and caching

## React & Components
- Use React 19 features appropriately, including hooks and functional components
- Avoid class components
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use proper React state management (useState, useReducer) for component state
- Implement proper error boundaries for component error handling
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization only when necessary

## TypeScript
- Maintain strict TypeScript typing (noImplicitAny: false is set, but prefer explicit types)
- Create proper interfaces and types for all data structures
- Use type guards when narrowing types
- Avoid using 'any' type unless absolutely necessary
- Use generics appropriately to create reusable components and functions

## Styling & UI
- Use Material UI (MUI) components consistently
- Follow the established theme configuration
- Implement responsive design using MUI's Grid and Box components
- Use CSS-in-JS with emotion for custom styling when needed
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG) in all UI components

## State Management
- Use React's built-in state management for component-level state
- For complex state, consider using React Context API with reducers
- Avoid introducing additional state management libraries unless necessary

## API & Data Fetching
- Use Supabase client for database operations
- Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- Use Next.js data fetching patterns (Server Components, getServerSideProps, etc.)
- Cache API responses appropriately to minimize redundant requests
- Implement proper loading and error states for all data fetching operations

## Database (Supabase)
- Follow the established database schema design
- Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control
- Write efficient SQL queries to minimize database load
- Implement proper database migrations for schema changes
- Use Supabase's built-in authentication system

## Testing
- Write Playwright E2E tests for critical user flows
- Implement component tests for complex UI components
- Follow the testing patterns established in the codebase
- Ensure tests are maintainable and not brittle

## Performance
- Optimize images and assets for web delivery
- Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading
- Monitor and optimize bundle sizes
- Use performance measurement tools to identify bottlenecks

## Security
- Follow OWASP security best practices
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Never commit secrets or API keys to the repository

## Deployment
- Follow the established CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Ensure builds pass all checks before deployment
- Use environment-specific configurations (.env files)
- Test deployments in staging environments before production

## Code Quality
- Follow ESLint rules configured in the project
- Use consistent code formatting
- Write meaningful comments and documentation
- Implement proper error handling throughout the application
- Use meaningful variable and function names
