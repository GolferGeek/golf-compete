# Overview
Golf Compete is transitioning to an API-based architecture to improve scalability, maintainability, and prepare for future AI integration. This conversion will separate front-end and back-end concerns while maintaining a clean, organized codebase structure.

# Core Features
1. API Endpoint Layer
   - Provides RESTful endpoints for all application functionality
   - Centralizes authentication and authorization
   - Handles request validation and error responses
   - Enables consistent data access patterns

2. Internal Tool/Service Layer
   - Encapsulates all Supabase interactions
   - Provides type-safe function interfaces
   - Maintains single responsibility principle
   - Enables future extensibility for AI integration

3. Authentication System
   - Comprehensive auth endpoint coverage
   - Session management
   - OAuth integration
   - Admin user management

4. Resource Management
   - Series, Events, and Courses management
   - Round tracking and scoring
   - User profiles and notes
   - Image and file storage

# User Experience
User Personas:
1. Front-end Developers
   - Need clear, well-documented API endpoints
   - Require consistent error handling
   - Expect type-safe interfaces

2. Back-end Developers
   - Need organized service layer
   - Require clear separation of concerns
   - Expect maintainable code structure

Key Flows:
1. Authentication Flow
   - Login/Register
   - Password reset
   - OAuth authentication
   - Session management

2. Data Management Flow
   - CRUD operations for all resources
   - File upload/download
   - Admin operations

# Technical Architecture
System Components:
1. API Layer (/api/*)
   - Route handlers
   - Request validation
   - Response formatting
   - Error handling

2. Service Layer
   - AuthService
   - DatabaseService
   - StorageService
   - Feature-specific services

3. Data Models
   - User/Profile
   - Series/Events
   - Courses/Rounds
   - Notes/Storage

Integration Points:
- Supabase Auth
- Supabase Database
- Supabase Storage
- OAuth Providers

# Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation
- Implement internal service layer
- Create base API structure
- Set up authentication endpoints
- Establish error handling patterns

Phase 2: Core Resources
- Implement Series/Events endpoints
- Add Courses/Rounds management
- Create Notes system
- Set up file storage endpoints

Phase 3: Front-end Integration
- Update components to use new API
- Implement proper data fetching
- Add loading states
- Error boundary implementation

Phase 4: Admin & Enhancement
- Add admin endpoints
- Implement advanced queries
- Add batch operations
- Optimize performance

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Foundation First
   - Internal service layer
   - Authentication system
   - Base API structure

2. Resource Implementation
   - Core data endpoints
   - File management
   - Basic queries

3. Front-end Updates
   - Component refactoring
   - Data fetching implementation
   - Error handling

4. Advanced Features

   - Performance optimization

# Risks and Mitigations
Technical Risks:
1. Data Migration
   - Risk: Data inconsistency during transition
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and validation

2. Performance Impact
   - Risk: Additional network requests
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and optimization

3. Authentication Complexity
   - Risk: Session management issues
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing of auth flows

Resource Risks:
1. Development Time
   - Risk: Extended refactoring period
   - Mitigation: Phased approach with incremental updates

2. Testing Coverage
   - Risk: Missing edge cases
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite
