# Plan for Converting Golf Compete to API-Based Architecture

## Objectives

- **API Integration**: Refactor the application to use APIs for all interactions with Supabase, enhancing modularity and separation of concerns.
- **MCP API Layer**: Implement a dedicated API layer for direct Supabase calls, which can also be utilized by an AI agent for advanced functionalities.
- **Maintain Existing Features**: Ensure all current features, such as series management, note-taking, coaching, and games, are preserved and enhanced through the new API structure.

## Steps to Transition

### 1. Identify Supabase Dependencies

- **Audit Current Codebase**: List all instances where Supabase is directly accessed in the codebase.
- **Categorize Calls**: Group these calls into categories such as authentication, data retrieval, and data manipulation.

### 2. Design API Endpoints

- **Define API Structure**: Create a clear structure for the API, including endpoints for each major feature (e.g., series, notes, coaching).
- **MCP API Layer**: Develop a separate layer for MCP (Modular Component Protocol) APIs that handle direct Supabase interactions. This layer will be designed to be accessible by both the front-end and the AI agent.

### 3. Implement API Endpoints

- **Develop Endpoints**: Implement the defined API endpoints using a framework like Express.js or NestJS within the existing project.
- **Integrate with Supabase**: Ensure each endpoint correctly interfaces with Supabase for data operations.

### 4. Refactor Front-End

- **Update Front-End Calls**: Modify the front-end to use the new API endpoints instead of direct Supabase calls.
- **Test Functionality**: Ensure all features work as expected with the new API-based architecture.

### 5. AI Agent Integration

- **Design AI Agent**: Plan the integration of an AI agent that can interact with the MCP API layer for advanced functionalities.
- **Implement AI Features**: Develop AI-driven features such as personalized coaching and game recommendations.

### 6. Testing and Validation

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure all features are functional and performant.
- **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from users to identify any issues or areas for improvement.

### 7. Deployment

- **Staged Deployment**: Deploy the updated application in stages, starting with a test environment before moving to production.
- **Monitor and Iterate**: Continuously monitor the application for any issues and iterate based on user feedback and performance metrics.

## Next Steps

- Begin by auditing the current codebase to identify all Supabase dependencies.
- Design the API structure and MCP layer.
- Implement the API endpoints and refactor the front-end accordingly.
